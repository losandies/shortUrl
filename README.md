Hello!

This is a link shortener that I've made using react. It's meant to....shorten links. Simple project but it's the first project that I've fully completed on my own and without any tutorials.

I utilized the bitly api to take in a user's input, then make an async fetch request which when finished will output the desired short url in a new component with a copy to clipboard function.
